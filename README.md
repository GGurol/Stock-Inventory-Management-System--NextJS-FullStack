---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Prisma)
- **Authentication:** Custom JWT, bcrypt
- **State Management:** React Context, custom hooks
- **Other:** Axios, js-cookie

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnobt78/Stock-Inventory-Managment--NextJS.git
cd Stock-Inventory-Managment--NextJS
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
```

- **DATABASE_URL:** Get your MongoDB connection string from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or your own MongoDB server.
- **JWT_SECRET:** Generate a strong random string (e.g., using [1Password password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/)).

**Never commit your .env file or secrets to version control!**

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are under `/api/` and require authentication (except login/register).

### Auth

- `POST /api/auth/login` â€” Login with email and password
- `POST /api/auth/register` â€” Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` â€” Logout (clears session)
- `GET /api/auth/session` â€” Get current user session

### Products

- `GET /api/products` â€” List all products for the user
- `POST /api/products` â€” Add a new product
- `PUT /api/products` â€” Update a product
- `DELETE /api/products` â€” Delete a product

### Categories

- `GET /api/categories` â€” List all categories
- `POST /api/categories` â€” Add a new category
- `PUT /api/categories` â€” Update a category
- `DELETE /api/categories` â€” Delete a category

### Suppliers

- `GET /api/suppliers` â€” List all suppliers
- `POST /api/suppliers` â€” Add a new supplier
- `PUT /api/suppliers` â€” Update a supplier
- `DELETE /api/suppliers` â€” Delete a supplier

---

## How It Works

1. **Authentication:**

- Users register and login with email/password.
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- On login, a JWT is issued and stored in a secure cookie (`session_id`).
- All protected API routes check the JWT for authentication.

2. **Product Management:**

- Authenticated users can add, edit, delete, and view products.
- Products are linked to categories and suppliers.
- Filtering, searching, and sorting are available in the UI.

3. **Category & Supplier Management:**

- Users can manage categories and suppliers for their products.

4. **UI & Components:**

- Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive look.
- All UI elements are reusable and customizable.

---

## Reusable Components & Usage

### Example: Using a Button from shadcn/ui

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>;
}
```

### Example: Product Table

```tsx
import { ProductTable } from "@/app/Products/ProductTable";

export default function ProductsPage() {
  return <ProductTable />;
}
```

### Custom Hooks

Use `useProductStore`, `useAuth`, and other hooks for state management and authentication.
